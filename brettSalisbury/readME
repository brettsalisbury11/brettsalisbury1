    I think my biggest successes and failures go hand in hand a tad bit. 
In my own preference I enjoy the minimalistic aspect of my resume. 
The way I was able to create hierarchy with bold and standard text is 
simple enough that it works for me. Along with the color changes from titles 
to the descriptions inside, the page becomes easier to read. Also I think 
I used white space and type weight in a consistent manner that breaks the page 
nicely. Where I think I might be lacking is the overall design of the resume, 
when I look at it now it might not be eye catching enough for someone to take the time to read it. 
I think it probably needs what could separate it from others, with that I mean more design elements
to personalize it further. Possibly a background image of some of my related work would be nice 
or a personalized logo for myself. I think I succeeded in creating a resume that is easy on the eye 
and looks typographically pleasing. From here on out it would definitely be important to find a way 
to set myself apart more. 
    
    For the imbedded technology that is used within along with important notes I’ll start here. 
I liked the look of the two box across container and thought it could create some nice hierarchy
with the most important information in the larger container. All my sections were created through
<h> sections with description tags inside, followed by description lists. This was the best way
to create lists with titles and distinguish through hierarchy. The box itself is responsive when the page size
is altered, however the way it opens up seems to be a little bugged. The resume’s main focus I would say probably 
is on the diversity of skills and specific abilities I learned through my work experience.
